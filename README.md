# Class-3-Civilisation
#### Humanity has finally advanced beyond the confinements of Earth in a new era of expansion. Create the best network of systems before you run out of systems to claim! This is a test of how well you can solve a complex problem to find the simplest solution.

##### You first start with the primary solar system and hover your mouse over another system that is nearby to add it to your collection. You can only claim the systems that are inside the radius of the outer most system before claiming outside. To win simply connect every single star system keeping in mind that it is best for the network to be as short as possible.

Sometimes at the beginning of the game there will be systems out of reach so you have to restart it
